# Skill inventory — Jev MCP

**Last reviewed:** 2026-10-16. Companion to [SKILL_CHANGE_AST10_REVIEW.md](SKILL_CHANGE_AST10_REVIEW.md)
and [SKILL_COMPILATION.md](SKILL_COMPILATION.md).
Update this file (new row or **Last reviewed** date) in the same PR as any skill change.

Risk tiers: **L1** = advisory/read-mostly (writes limited to docs/reports); **L2** = can run
commands or edit code/config as part of its procedure.

Commands (`.claude/commands/`) and rules (`.claude/rules/`) are catalogued in
[AGENT_INFRA_INVENTORY.md](AGENT_INFRA_INVENTORY.md); they follow the same review process.

## Frontmatter invariants (CI-enforced)

`scripts/ci/check_agent_frontmatter.py` enforces these on every PR:

- **Skills:** YAML frontmatter required; `name` is the **first** key and matches the directory
  name; `description` is non-empty; skill names are unique across the tree.
- **Agents:** frontmatter required; `name` matches the file stem; `description` non-empty; names unique.
- **Commands:** YAML frontmatter required and H1 heading of the form `# /<file-stem> …`.
- **Rules:** frontmatter required with non-empty `description`.
- **Commands, skills, and agents:** frontmatter must include the metadata contract fields below
  wherever the field applies to the asset:
  - `capability` — short user-facing statement of what the asset enables.
  - `side_effect_level` — one of `read_only`, `local_write`, `remote_write`,
    `external_export`. Use `external_export` when repository context or task data leaves the
    local workspace, and `remote_write` for GitHub PR/issue/project mutations.
  - `approval_required` — boolean `true` or `false`. Use `true` for high-risk external export
    assets and remote mutations that require explicit human approval.
  - `requires_tools` — compact scalar summary of required CLIs, MCP tools, or platform APIs.
  - `output_schema` — compact scalar summary of the expected response/report shape.
  - `risk_class` — one of `low`, `medium`, `high`.
- **High-risk external review assets:** `risk_class: high` external Codex/Gemini/subagent review
  assets must also set `side_effect_level: external_export` and `approval_required: true`.
- **PR/issue/project mutation commands:** commands that mutate GitHub PRs, issues, or Project
  boards must set `side_effect_level: remote_write`.
- **Model pins:** if a command/skill/agent frontmatter sets `model`, the value must be a bare tier
  alias (`opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `fable`) — never a pinned version ID or a `[1m]`-suffixed ID.
  Aliases resolve at dispatch so one definition follows the asset across model generations and
  providers; a pinned ID silently keeps pointing at its generation after a switch, and a suffixed ID
  cannot be inherited by subagents. Only enforced when a `model` key is present.
- **All files:** plain scalar frontmatter keys only — no exotic YAML tags (`!!`).

Use `python scripts/migrate_agent_frontmatter.py` to populate missing command, skill, and agent
metadata defaults before hand-tuning values. Use `--check` in CI or review workflows to report
assets that still need migration without rewriting files.

Violations fail CI; fix the asset rather than the checker. If the contract itself must change,
update the checker, this file, and [SKILL_CHANGE_AST10_REVIEW.md](SKILL_CHANGE_AST10_REVIEW.md)
in the same PR.

CLI skill structure is additionally checked by `scripts/validate_cli_skills.py`.
Jev MCP skill reviewed for 0.3.0: image/Box/long-context opt-ins, bounded local paths,
external-export approval, offline evaluation commands, and model-default migration.

Framework workflow skills reviewed for 0.3.0: all 25 `framework-*` wrappers preserve
their command counterparts' six safety metadata fields and explicit-invocation restriction.
Relative links resolve from the skill directory; hypothetical destinations are literal examples.
AST10 review: no new tools, permissions or export paths; external-review wrappers retain
`external_export` / approval-required / high-risk metadata. Qualitative review covers this
metadata/link-only repair; the existing frontmatter and sync gates verify the contracts.
